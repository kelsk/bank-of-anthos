# Bank of Anthos as Custom Templates for Cloud Code

The Custom Templates directory contains modified copies of the Bank of Anthos services. The services included here have been converted into custom templates, with much of their logic removed. The templates can be used by the fictional Bank of Anthos to provide their developers with a base pattern from which to build services similar to the existing ones.

These templates are meant to be used with the Custom Templates feature for Google's [Cloud Code](https://cloud.google.com/code). You can compare these templates with the finished version of the service to see how Cloud Code Custom Templates can function in a large-scale engineering environment.
